experience descriptions

For a summer internship as a sophomore, I had the opportunity to work as a software engineer for the Aladdin Product Group (APG). Along with three other interns, I developed a web application for teams within the company to track their integration tests, unit tests, and other methods of quality assurance. Our project allowed data from project builds to be added to our database and displayed on the dashboard in an accessible way. Technologies used to develop this dashboard include: Angular, HTML, TypeScript, Java.
