# this theme rocks. -->

<p>My name is Evi Salguero. Iâ€™m a junior at Georgia Institute of Technology studying computer science. During my time at Tech Iâ€™ve been involved with the College of Computing as an undergrad TA, teaching Python and helping students learn the foundations of computing. Iâ€™ve also been involved with other Tech students in the Christian Students club. Being a part of the community at Tech and the greater Atlanta area has been awesome.</p>

<p>My time at college (at least undergrad) will soon be coming to an end but I will be looking for full-time employment opportunities after Spring 2021. Reach out to learn more!</p>
