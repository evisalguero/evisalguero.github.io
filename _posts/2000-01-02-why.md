<!-- #### Basically

# this theme rocks. -->

My name is Evi Salguero. I'm a junior at Georgia Institute of Technology studying computer science. During my time at Tech I've been involved with the College of Computing as an undergrad TA, teaching Python and helping students learn the foundations of computing. I've also been involved with other Tech students in the Christian Students club. Being a part of the community at Tech and the greater Atlanta area has been awesome.

My time at college (at least undergrad) will soon be coming to an end but I will be looking for full-time employment opportunities after Spring 2021. Reach out to learn more!
